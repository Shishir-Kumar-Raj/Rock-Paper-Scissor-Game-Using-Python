# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game-Using-Python

This is a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game designed for the command line using Python. Upon launching, the game greets the user and asks whether they wish to play by typing 'y' for yes or 'n' for no. If the user opts to play, they are prompted to select one of the three available options: rock, paper, or scissor. Simultaneously, the computer randomly selects its choice from the same set. The winner is determined using the traditional rules: rock crushes scissor, scissor cuts paper, and paper covers rock. If both choices are identical, the game ends in a draw. The program checks for valid inputs and provides feedback if the user's input is invalid, encouraging them to enter a correct option. The game runs in a loop, allowing multiple rounds until the user decides to stop by entering 'n'. It concludes with a thank-you message. This game is a great exercise for beginners to practice fundamental Python concepts, including loops, conditional statements, user input, and randomization.
